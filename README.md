A very basic weather web app, using node.js. It uses the mapbox geocoder api to generate coordinated from a search, and the openweathermap api to obtain weather data from them.

The project started out as an attempt to get to grips with building a basic node.js backend. That turned out to be much more straightforward than I imagined, and it has now become a bit of front end playground for me, to practice implementing some neat transitions etc. 

The scope is very limited, and my free API key doesn't grant very many requests - it's available at <strong>node-weather.herokuapp.com</strong>, so feel free to have a go! Depending on when you're reading this it'll either be extremely barebones or a bit more fully featured.

Notably, it doesn't seem to return reliable data for North Korea.
